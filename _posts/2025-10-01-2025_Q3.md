description: Review of my third quarter of 2025

## Air Force Life  

Got promoted to staff sergeant back in August. Honestly, nothing really changed. We’re still short on new recruits, so the workload feels the same. My stamina’s kinda dropping too. Gym routine is barely hanging on — no gains, just maintenance.  

Life in the Air Force comes with people stress, but I think I’m handling it fine. October’s packed with training, November looks relaxed, and from December I’ll finally be off base and spend time at home.  


## Go  

After trying out Solidity and Rust, I decided to pick up Golang. I really want to make it my main language for a few reasons:
1. Microservices, networking, cloud-native — all my interests fit.  
2. Many blockchain protocols have solid Go implementations.  
3. It’s clean, fast, and doesn’t feel bloated.  

Right now I’m on some Go microservice tutorials, going through the docs, and reading *Network Automation with Go*. Next step will be jumping into go-ethereum and go-algorand.


## American Dream  

Since high school, I’ve pictured myself in the U.S. — Silicon Valley, working with super-talented people, right at the edge of innovation. My original plan was very straightforward: grad school → OPT → H-1B → green card.  

Now I see it a bit differently. My main goal is to grow into a global-level engineer, and location comes second. The U.S. is still an important part of that dream, but I’ve realized there are strong teams everywhere in the world.  

Right now, I’m following some leading teams in Korea, and I’m also keeping an eye on the growing remote opportunities with global teams in the crypto industry.
